Want to report a bug? Before you do, please read the following guidelines. Submission context \u00b6 Got a question or problem? \u00b6 For quick questions there's no need to open an issue as you can reach us on gitter.im . Found a bug? \u00b6 If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to the issue tracker in our GitHub repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. However, before doing so, please read the submission guidelines . Missing a feature? \u00b6 You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first. Please consider what kind of change it is: For a major feature , first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. Small features and bugs can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into the master, as it's always a matter of opinion whether it benefits the overall functionality of the library. Submission guidelines \u00b6 Submitting an issue \u00b6 Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available. We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the custom issue template. Please stick to the issue template. Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear back from you we may close the issue. Submitting a Pull Request (PR) \u00b6 Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR, go ahead. Development : Fork the project and make your changes in a separate git branch and add descriptive messages to your commits. Build : Before submitting a pull requests, run a gradle build. This is a mandatory requirement for your PR to get accepted, as the library should at all times be installable through GitHub (Such as through https://jitpack.io/). Pull Request : Send a PR to KFormMaster:master . If we suggest changes, make the required updates, rebase your branch and push the changes to your GitHub repository, which will automatically update your PR. After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"about/contributing/#contributing","text":"Interested in contributing to KFormMaster?

Base Value Requirements None of the base values are required but providing a title is advised. Editable fields that require a keyboard change the form element value when they lose focus. Because of this, before validating or submitting a form, clear the focus of the form using currentFocus?.clearFocus() in your activity. Setting Colors Setting the form element colors requires a Color Int R.color.name is a Color Res and you must get the Color Int using ResourcesCompat.getColor() or similar Examples: Color.WHITE Color.parseColor(\"#FF4081\") ResourcesCompat.getColor(resources, R.color.name, null) Tag \u00b6 The tag is an integer used to easily get a form element later. You can also retrieve a form element by the index it was inserted into the form elements list. text ( 1 ) { } email ( Tag . Email . ordinal ) { } val textElement = formBuilder . getElementAtIndex ( 0 ) as FormSingleLineEditTextElement val emailElement = formBuilder . getFormElement < FormEmailEditTextElement >( Tag . Email . ordinal ) Title \u00b6 The title is the text displayed next to the value of the form element. text { title = getString ( R . string . title ) } Value \u00b6 The value is the value of the form element. Depending on the form element, this can be a String, Date, or an object of your choice. text { value = \"Hello World\" } autoComplete < ContactItem > { value = ContactItem ( id = 1 , value = \"John Smith\" ) } Value Observers \u00b6 The list of value observers are fired when the form element value changes. When a value changes, the Unit passes in the new value and form element. text { value = \"Hello World\" valueObservers . add ({ newValue , element -> Toast . makeText ( this @FormActivity , newValue , LENGTH_SHORT ). show () }) } On Click Unit \u00b6 This unit is invoked when the form element is clicked. NOTE: The click event is not fired when a text field is clicked on to focus. Use onFocus to get the event when a field has focus. text { onClick = { Toast . makeText ( this @FormActivity , this . javaClass . simpleName , LENGTH_SHORT ). show () } } On Focus Unit \u00b6 This unit is invoked when the form element is focused. text { onFocus = { Toast . makeText ( this @FormActivity , this . javaClass . simpleName , LENGTH_SHORT ). show () } } On Touch Up Unit \u00b6 This unit is invoked when the form element is touched up. text { onTouchUp = { Toast . makeText ( this @FormActivity , this . javaClass . simpleName , LENGTH_SHORT ). show () } } On Touch Down Unit \u00b6 This unit is invoked when the form element is touched down. text { onTouchDown = { Toast . makeText ( this @FormActivity , this . javaClass . simpleName , LENGTH_SHORT ). show () } } On Title Icon Click Unit \u00b6 This unit is invoked when the title's icon is clicked. text { onTitleIconClick = { Toast . makeText ( this @FormActivity , \"Icon clicked\" , LENGTH_SHORT ). show () } } Options \u00b6 The list of options is used in form elements such as the Form Picker Dropdown Element and Form Picker MultiCheckBox Element. private val fruits = listOf ( ListItem ( id = 1 , name = \"Banana\" ), ListItem ( id = 2 , name = \"Orange\" ), ListItem ( id = 3 , name = \"Mango\" ), ListItem ( id = 4 , name = \"Guava\" ), ListItem ( id = 5 , name = \"Apple\" ) ) dropDown < ListItem > { options = fruits value = ListItem ( id = 1 , name = \"Banana\" ) } multiCheckBox < List < ListItem >> { options = fruits value = listOf ( ListItem ( id = 1 , name = \"Banana\" )) } Update On Focus Change \u00b6 By default this is false. An EditText will update the form value as characters are typed. Setting this to true will only update the value when focus is lost or if Done is tapped on the keyboard. (See IME Options) text { updateOnFocusChange = true } Input Type \u00b6 By default this is set by the form element type. Setting this will override the EditText form element's Input Type. text { inputType = InputType . TYPE_CLASS_TEXT or InputType . TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS } IME Options \u00b6 By default this is EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_NEXT. Setting this will override the EditText form element's IME Options. If EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_DONE is used, tapping Done on the keyboard will update the form element value. text { imeOptions = EditorInfo . IME_ACTION_DONE } Input Mask Options \u00b6 By default edit text fields will not have any input mask format. Setting an input mask format will format the text field for the set value and as you type. phone { inputMaskOptions = InputMaskOptions ( primaryFormat = \"+1 ([000]) [000]-[0000]\" ) } Hint \u00b6 The hint is the hint (or placeholder) of the value field. text { hint = \"Enter a name\" } Max Length \u00b6 By default this is null which means that there is no max text length. Max length represents the number of characters the value field will allow. Unsupported Fields AutoComplete AutoCompleteToken text { maxLength = 10 } Max Lines \u00b6 By default this is 1. TextArea defaults to 4. Max lines represents the number of lines the value field will display. Unsupported Fields Password Number Text (Use TextArea instead) textArea { maxLines = 3 } Right To Left (RTL) \u00b6 By default this is true. This determines the gravity of the text in the value field. text { rightToLeft = false } Center Text \u00b6 By default this is false. This uses the Center gravity for the text in the value field. text { centerText = true } Error \u00b6 This is the error text displayed in red below the form element. text { error = \"That's an error\" } Required \u00b6 By default this is false. Setting required to true will cause FormBuildHelper.isValidForm to return false if a value is not set. text { required = true } Clearable \u00b6 By default this is false. Setting this to true will display a clear button (X) to set the value to null. Unsupported Fields AutoComplete AutoCompleteToken text { clearable = true } Title Icon \u00b6 By default this is null. Setting this will set and display the title icon drawable (null will hide the icon). text { titleIcon = ContextCompat . getDrawable ( this @FormActivity , R . drawable . ic_email_blue_24dp ) } Title Icon Location \u00b6 By default this is IconTextView.Location.LEFT. Setting this set the title icon location (LEFT or RIGHT of the title). text { titleIconLocation = IconTextView . Location . RIGHT } Title Icon Padding \u00b6 By default this is 20. Setting this set the padding between the title text and icon. text { titleIconPadding = 25 } Clear On Focus \u00b6 By default this is false. Setting this to true will clear the text value of the form element when focused. Unsupported Fields AutoComplete AutoCompleteToken text { clearOnFocus = true } Visible \u00b6 By default this is true. Setting visible to false will hide the form element. text { visible = false } Enabled \u00b6 By default this is true. Setting enabled to false will disable the form element. This means that the click event will not fire when tapped, the text will be grayed out, and the value cannot be edited. Text View Use the TextView element if you just want a simple uneditable text element. text { enabled = false } Clickable \u00b6 By default this is true. Setting clickable to false will disable click events. Use focusable Click events will still be fired unless focusable is also set to false. text { clickable = false } Focusable \u00b6 By default this is true. Setting focusable to false will prevent a field from being focused. Focusable elements This value does not change the behavior of the form elements that cannot be focused. text { focusable = false } Display Divider \u00b6 By default this is true. Setting displayDivider to false will hide the divider line displayed before the element. text { displayDivider = true } Display Title \u00b6 By default this is true. Setting displayTitle to false will hide the title. text { displayTitle = true } Layout Padding Bottom (DP) \u00b6 By default, this will use android:paddingBottom in the XML. Setting layoutPaddingBottom will override the bottom padding of the form element. text { layoutPaddingBottom = 0 } Title Padding (DP) \u00b6 Setting padding will override the padding of the form element title view. FormElementPadding FormElementPadding is a simple class to set all padding. text { titlePadding = FormElementPadding ( /* Left */ 16 , /* Top */ 16 , /* Right */ 16 , /* Bottom */ 0 ) } Padding (DP) \u00b6 Setting padding will override the padding of the form element edit view. FormElementPadding FormElementPadding is a simple class to set all padding. text { padding = FormElementPadding ( /* Left */ 16 , /* Top */ 16 , /* Right */ 16 , /* Bottom */ 0 ) } Margins (DP) \u00b6 By default, this will use layout_margin values in the XML. Setting margins will override the margins of the form element. FormElementMargins FormElementMargins is a simple class to set all margins. text { margins = FormElementMargins ( /* Left */ 16 , /* Top */ 16 , /* Right */ 16 , /* Bottom */ 0 ) } Confirm Edit \u00b6 By default this is false. Setting confirmEdit to true will display an alert dialog confirming if the user wishes to edit the value if a current value exists. Currently, this only applies to the picker elements that display a dialog. date { confirmEdit = true } Confirm Title \u00b6 By default this is \"Confirm Edit\". Setting this will override the confirm edit dialog title. date { confirmTitle = \"Really edit this?\" } Confirm Message \u00b6 By default this is \"Edit this value?\". Setting this will override the confirm edit dialog message. date { confirmMessage = \"Are you ABSOLUTELY sure?\" } Background Color \u00b6 By default this is the value of R.Color.colorFormMasterElementBackground. Setting this will override the background color. text { backgroundColor = Color . WHITE } Title Text Color \u00b6 By default this is the value of R.Color.colorFormMasterElementTextTitle. Setting this will override the title text color. text { titleTextColor = Color . BLACK } Title Focused Text Color \u00b6 By default this is the value of R.Color.colorFormMasterElementFocusedTitle. Setting this will override the title text (when focused) color. text { titleFocusedTextColor = Color . BLACK } Value Text Color \u00b6 By default this is the value of R.Color.colorFormMasterElementTextValue. Setting this will override the value text color. text { valueTextColor = Color .
